# Bug Hunt: Tic Tac Toe üêû‚ùå‚≠ïÔ∏è

## Overview
Bug Hunt is a debugging game where players identify and fix bugs in a Tic Tac Toe game implementation written in Python. The game provides an interactive and educational way to learn about debugging techniques while having fun.

## Game Setup
1. The Tic Tac Toe game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players, X and O, take turns marking cells on the grid.
3. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marker wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Instructions
1. Clone the Bug Hunt: Tic Tac Toe repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Tic Tac Toe Python file in your preferred code editor.
3. Read through the code to understand its structure and functionality.
4. Run the Python file to play the game and observe any unexpected behavior.
5. Use debugging techniques such as print statements, stepping through code, and inspecting variable values to identify and fix bugs.
6. Test your fixes by running the game again and ensuring it behaves as expected.
7. Repeat the process until all bugs are resolved and the game functions correctly.



## Bugs to Hunt
1. Incorrect win detection logic.
2. Incorrect handling of draw conditions.
3. Potential index out of range errors.
4. Inconsistent player turn switching.
5. Lack of input validation for player moves.

## Tips for Bug Hunting
1. Start by running the game and observing its behavior.
2. Break down the code into smaller components and test each part individually.
3. Use print statements to display variable values and program flow.
4. Step through the code using a debugger to identify the source of errors.
5. Review the game's logic and compare it to the expected behavior.
6. Collaborate with others and seek help from online resources if needed.

## Conclusion
Bug Hunt: Tic Tac Toe provides a hands-on learning experience in debugging Python code. By identifying and fixing bugs in the Tic Tac Toe game implementation, players develop their problem-solving skills and gain confidence in troubleshooting software issues.

Have fun hunting bugs and happy debugging!
